# NitrousTracker

NitrousTracker is a fork of NitroTracker, a FastTracker II style tracker for the Nintendo DS originally created by 0xtob. If you didn't understand that, you might want to read up on trackers. For starters, NitrousTracker is a versatile tool for creating music - everywhere! It supports the popular XM file format that is used by many PC trackers and that can be played on many PC audio players such as Winamp or XMMS.
